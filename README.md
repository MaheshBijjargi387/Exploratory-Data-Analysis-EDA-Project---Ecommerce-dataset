# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project---Ecommerce-dataset
##Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to master Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Pandas framework. The dataset is related to healthcare transactions, patient demographics, medical conditions, and billing information, which will be analyzed to derive insights and support strategic decision-making in healthcare management.
##Goals of the Project
1.Explore the healthcare dataset using Pandas.
2.Perform feature engineering to derive useful insights, such as patient age groups and stay duration.
3.Visualize data distributions and trends using various plot types.
4.Summarize key findings that can aid in improving patient care and optimizing healthcare management.
##Technologies Used
1.NumPy – Numerical computations

2.Pandas – Data analysis and manipulation

3.Matplotlib – Data visualization
