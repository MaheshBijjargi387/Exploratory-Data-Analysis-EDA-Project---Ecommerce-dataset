# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-Project---Healthcare-Data

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to master Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in healthcare using the Pandas framework. The dataset contains healthcare-related information, including patient data, medical histories, and treatment outcomes. The analysis will uncover valuable insights to assist in healthcare decision-making and policy formulation.

## Goals of the Project
1. Explore the healthcare dataset using Pandas.
2. Perform feature engineering to derive valuable insights for improving healthcare services.
3. Visualize data distributions and trends using various plot types.
4. Summarize key findings that can aid in healthcare decision-making.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes information on patient demographics, medical conditions, diagnoses, treatment plans, and outcomes. The goal is to understand patterns in healthcare data and suggest improvements.

## Technologies Used
The following libraries were used for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization:
1. **NumPy** – Numerical computations
2. **Pandas** – Data analysis and manipulation
3. **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
